  the user wants to audit the knowledge base quality.

# /health — Knowledge Health Check

Scan the four agent-maintained directories (`entities/`, `concepts/`, `comparisons/`, `queries/`)
for structural issues.

## Prerequisites Check

```bash
obsidian --version
```

If this fails, STOP and display the Obsidian CLI availability message (see /prep).

## Scan Categories

### 1. Orphan Pages
Pages with no inbound wikilinks from any other note (user notes or agent pages).
- Severity: **warning** for new pages (< 7 days old), **info** for older

### 2. Broken Wikilinks
Wikilinks in agent pages that point to non-existent targets.
- Severity: **warning**

### 3. Stale Content
Pages where `updated` date is > 90 days behind the most recent source note's date.
- Severity: **info**

### 4. Frontmatter Violations
Pages missing required fields (`title`, `date`, `created`, `updated`, `type`, `tags`, `sources`).
- Severity: **warning** for missing required fields

### 5. Tag Taxonomy Drift
Tags used in agent pages that are not defined in `SCHEMA.md`.
- Severity: **info**

### 6. Oversized Pages
Pages exceeding ~200 lines — candidates for splitting.
- Severity: **info**
